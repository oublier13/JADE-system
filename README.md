# JADE-system

As an important material carrier of Chinese civilisation, the intelligent recognition of jade artefacts holds significant importance for cultural heritage protection and the authentication of artworks. This paper proposes a lightweight dual-branch convolutional neural network system, JADE, specifically designed for jade artifact image recognition. By integrating detection, segmentation, and retrieval into a unified workflow, the system achieves efficient intelligent recognition of jade artifacts. The system consists of two components: JADE-Det (object detection) and JADE-Ret (image classification), both featuring lightweight architectures. These are complemented by multi-scale frequency enhancement modules and Gabor attention modules, specifically designed to address the challenges posed by the complex textures of jade artifact images. Experimental results show that in jade detection tasks, JADE-Det achieves AP75 and AP50-95 of 97.0% and 97.2%, respectively, with only 1.25 million learnable parameters and 0.3 GFLOPs of computational power. In jade classification tasks, JADE-Ret achieves an accuracy rate of 91.9% with only 0.84 million parameters and 0.09 GFLOPs. These results demonstrate that the JADE system can balance high accuracy and real-time performance under lightweight deployment conditions, providing practical intelligent assistance tools for scenarios such as museums and auction houses.
